    <p class="intro-text">
      In October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean DMC-12 was completed by William T. Collins, chief engineer and
      designer (formerly chief engineer at Pontiac). Originally, the car's rear-mounted power plant was to be a Citroën
      Wankel rotary engine, but was replaced with a French-designed and produced PRV (Peugeot-Renault-Volvo) fuel
      injected V-6 because of the poor fuel economy of the rotary engine, an important issue at a time of world-wide
      fuel shortages. Collins and DeLorean envisioned a chassis produced from a new and untested manufacturing
      technology known as Elastic Reservoir Moulding (ERM), which would contribute to the light-weight characteristics
      of the car while presumably lowering its production costs. This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased
      patent rights, would eventually be found to be unsuitable for mass production.
      These and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures. The entire car was deemed
      to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer Colin Chapman, founder and owner of
      Lotus. Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those currently being
      employed by Lotus. The backbone chassis is very similar to the Lotus Esprit. The original Giorgetto Giugiaro body
      design was left mostly intact, as were the distinctive stainless steel outer skin panels and gull-wing doors.
      The DMC-12 would eventually be built in a factory in Dunmurry, Northern Ireland, a neighborhood a few miles from
      Belfast city center. Construction on the factory began in October 1978, and although production of the DMC-12 was
      scheduled to start in 1979, engineering issues and budget overruns delayed production until early 1981. By that
      time, the unemployment rate was high in Northern Ireland and local residents lined up to apply for jobs at the
      factory. The production personnel were largely inexperienced, but were paid premium wages and supplied with the
      best equipment available. Most quality issues were solved by 1982 and the cars were sold from dealers with a 12
      month, 12,000 mi (19,300 km) warranty and an available five-year, 50,000-mile (80,000 km) service contract.
      The De Lorean Motor Company went bankrupt in late 1982 following John DeLorean's arrest in October of that year on
      drug trafficking charges. He was later found not guilty, but it was too late for the DMC-12. Approximately 100
      partially assembled DMC's on the production line were completed by Consolidated International (now known as Big
      Lots). The remaining parts from the factory stock, the parts from the US Warranty Parts Center, as well as parts
      from the original suppliers that had not yet been delivered to the factory were all shipped to Columbus, Ohio in
      1983–1984. A company called KAPAC sold these parts to retail and wholesale customers via mail order. In 1997, De
      Lorean Motor Company of Texas acquired this inventory.[2]

        The aircraft is nearly 20 feet long and 18.5 feet wide, but the wings do a clever Transformers-style hinge and
        pivot to tuck in against the side, so it can squeeze into a large garage. Propulsion is all electric, and
        DeLorean aims to make the craft self-flying, so anyone can use it, no special license required.

        In the Back to the Future franchise, the DeLorean time machine is a time travel device made by retrofitting a
        DMC DeLorean vehicle with a flux capacitor. The car requires 1.21 gigawatts ("jigawatts/jigowatts") of power and
        needs to travel 88 miles per hour (142 km/h) to initiate time travel.

        Gale and Zemeckis conceived the idea for Back to the Future in 1980. They were desperate for a successful film
        after numerous collaborative failures, but the project was rejected over 40 times by various studios because it
        was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era.

      The gull-winged car produced by the DeLorean Motor Company. Although the official name of the car was "DeLorean
      DMC-12", most people referred to the car simply as "The DeLorean". The futuristic car became even more popular
      after its usage in the "Back to the Future" trilogy.
