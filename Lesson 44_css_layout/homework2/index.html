  <h2>Delorean DMC-12</h2>
  <p>The DMC DeLorean is a rear-engine two-passenger sports car
    manufactured and marketed by John DeLorean's DeLorean Motor
    Company (DMC) for the American market from 1981 until
    1983â€”ultimately the only car brought to market by the fledgling
    company. The DeLorean is sometimes referred to by its internal
    DMC pre-production designation, DMC-12.[10][11][12] However,
    the DMC-12 name was never used in sales or marketing materials
    for the production model.[13]</p>
